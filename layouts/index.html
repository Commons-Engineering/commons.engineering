    <h1>The Home for Building Living Systems</h1>
    <p class="hero-subtitle">Some systems thrive. Others just survive. The difference is rarely technology — it's design. If you've always sensed that the best organizations, communities, and ecosystems grow more like gardens than machines, you've found your place.</p>

<!-- Narrative -->
<div class="page-section bg-white">
  <div class="container narrative">
    <p>The world is full of systems designed for control and predictability. But the world itself is neither controllable nor predictable. When a system can't adapt, it becomes brittle — it loses its best people, misses vital signals, and slowly decays. We keep optimizing the parts, forgetting that the health of the whole is what matters.</p>
    <p>Commons Engineering is a different approach. It's the discipline of designing and stewarding systems that are alive, adaptive, and resilient. Not a rigid methodology, but a shared language and a growing body of knowledge for seeing, understanding, and cultivating the forces that give a system its vitality.</p>
