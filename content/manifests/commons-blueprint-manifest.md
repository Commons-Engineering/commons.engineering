# COMMONS BLUEPRINT MANIFEST
*v0.3 — The Primary Artefact of Commons Engineering Practice*

---

## Preamble: Temporal Specification, Not Linear Planning

Traditional planning projects a sequence of intended actions forward from a known present into a single imagined future. It treats time as a line and the future as a prediction. When the environment deviates — as it always does — the plan becomes obsolete.

A Commons Blueprint is something different. It is a **temporal specification**: a structured description of what a living system *is* — and what it should *become* — at multiple time horizons simultaneously. The Blueprint holds a baseline (the system as it exists today), a near-term timeslice (the system as it should be in 12-24 months), a long-horizon timeslice (the system as it should be in 3-5+ years), and alternative scenario timeslices (the system as it should be if the environment shifts in different directions). None of these are predictions. They are design targets — specifications of intended states that the community commits to engineering toward.

The work of moving between timeslices is **transition engineering**: the systematic process of sensing current state, identifying the gap against the next timeslice, designing the transition path using proven patterns, and building the next state deliberately. The Blueprint is both the map and the instrument of navigation.

There is a useful distinction between two phases of Blueprint existence. A **Blueprint Specification** is the design document: the authored, time-sliced artefact the Commons Engineer produces with a community, describing the intended state of the system across all nine layers. It is a plan held deliberately and provisionally — precise enough to be challenged by reality. A **Living Blueprint** is what the Specification becomes when connected to the Context Engine and continuous sensing: a model that holds not only the design intent but the history of decisions made, the patterns applied and adapted, and the signals that indicate when the design needs to respond. The engineer authors the Specification; the engine sustains the currency of the Living Blueprint.

In the cognitive era, the time between timeslice updates compresses. AI-assisted sensing and monitoring generates continuous data about the system's state. Communities that operate with rich Physiology layers (L7-L9) can update their Blueprints in near-real-time — closing the gap between design and reality until the distinction between timeslices begins to dissolve. The Blueprint becomes less a document updated quarterly and more a living model updated continuously: higher frames per second, until the specification and the system are effectively the same thing.

The Commons Engineer does not deliver a specification and walk away. They help a community build the Blueprint — and the sensing, governance, and learning systems — that allow the community to keep engineering its own evolution indefinitely.

## §1 Why This Manifest Exists

The Commons Blueprint is the primary artefact of Commons Engineering practice. Every Commons Engineer, in every domain, produces Blueprints. A Life Engineer produces Life Blueprints for individuals navigating identity and vitality. A Business Engineer produces Business Blueprints for organisations designing themselves as living systems. An Urban Engineer produces Urban Blueprints for cities and bioregions stewarding their habitat commons. An Ecology Engineer produces Ecology Blueprints for communities co-designing their participation in planetary living systems. When the situation demands it, any of these Engineers may draw on patterns from the Emerging Commons — the frontier domain where governance frameworks do not yet exist and patterns are built from first principles alone.

These are not four different artefacts. They are four domain specialisations of a single underlying architecture — the Commons Blueprint — which specifies the complete structure of any resilient, collaborative, vital value-creating system, regardless of the domain in which it operates.

This manifest establishes what a Commons Blueprint is, how it is structured, how it relates to the four domains of Commons Engineering practice, and how it connects to the pattern library that gives it substance. It is the foundation upon which every domain Blueprint is built.

---

## §2 What a Commons Blueprint Is

A Commons Blueprint is a **domain-agnostic, nine-layer temporal specification for designing, building, and continuously evolving any resilient, collaborative, vital value-creating system of systems**.

Four concepts in that definition carry the most weight.

**Domain-agnostic** — the architecture does not change between a Life Blueprint and an Urban Blueprint. The layers, their sequence, and their relationships are the same. What changes is the domain-specific content within each layer: the purpose of an individual life is not the same kind of entity as the purpose of a city, but both are specified in L1, using the same structural logic and the same pattern language. This universality is what makes cross-domain insight possible, and what allows a Commons Engineer trained in one domain to contribute meaningfully in another.

**Nine-layer** — the Blueprint organises the specification of a living system into nine distinct layers, each addressing a different dimension of the system's structure or behaviour. The layers are not a checklist; they are an architecture. Each layer has its own patterns, its own rate of change, and its own relationship to the layers above and below it. Together they constitute the complete specification of a living system — from identity and purpose to adaptive intelligence and self-renewal.

**Temporal specification** — the Blueprint holds the system's description simultaneously at multiple time horizons: the baseline (current state), the near-term timeslice (intended state in 12-24 months), the long-horizon timeslice (intended state in 3-5+ years), and scenario variants for different environmental futures. Each timeslice is a complete specification of all nine layers — not a list of actions, but a design target. The transition between timeslices is engineered systematically, using sensing data to validate assumptions and patterns to design the path forward.

**Continuously evolving** — the Blueprint is not produced once and filed. It is kept current by the same community that operates the system. Sensing data from the Physiology layers continuously challenges and refines the Anatomy. When reality contradicts a design assumption — including the assumption about purpose — the Blueprint is updated. The community that stops updating its Blueprint has stopped engineering. Its system will drift until external forces impose a change the community did not design.

## §3 The Blueprint and the Four Domains

The Commons Engineering Manifest establishes four commons domains of practice, organised by the scale of the living system being stewarded: Life, Business, Urban, and Ecology. The Emerging Commons is not a fifth domain but a temporary pattern source — the anticipatory frontier where patterns are born from first principles before migrating into the established domains as they mature.

The Commons Blueprint applies to all four domains — not by stretching a business framework into other domains, but by establishing an architecture at a level of abstraction genuinely prior to any domain. The nine layers describe what every resilient, collaborative, vital value-creating system must specify, regardless of scale. What the domain specialisation adds is the vocabulary, the collaborator set, the vitality measures, and the temporal rhythms appropriate to that scale.

The domain Blueprints are therefore not adaptations of a business tool. They are equal specialisations of a universal architecture:

- **Life Blueprint** — specifies an individual life as a living system. L1 holds the Life Purpose Spiral (Purpose, Health, Relationships, Wealth). The governance layer (L3) addresses personal decision-making systems and the role of the intimate community. The Physiology layers (L7-L9) address personal feedback loops, life sensing, and adaptive learning. Timeslices are personal time horizons — where am I now, where do I intend to be in one year, in five years, and in alternative scenarios if life changes direction.

- **Business Blueprint** — specifies an organisation as a living system. L1 holds the Business Purpose Spiral (Purpose, Agents, Offers & Operations). The Physiology layers address operational cadence, performance sensing, and organisational learning. Timeslices correspond to strategic horizons — baseline operations, near-term transformation, long-horizon evolution.

- **Urban Blueprint** — specifies a human settlement as a living system. L1 holds the Urban Purpose Spiral (Purpose, Agents, Offers & Operations). The Physiology layers address urban metabolism: the flows of people, materials, energy, and information through the city. Timeslices span decades — urban systems change slowly, and long-horizon specification is essential for the decisions that shape generations.

- **Ecology Blueprint** — specifies human participation in a planetary living system. L1 holds the Ecology Purpose Spiral (Ecosystem Identity, Biodiversity & Flows, Stewardship Architecture, Regenerative Capacity). The Physiology layers address ecological sensing: monitoring the living system's own signals rather than imposing external metrics. Timeslices are calibrated to ecological rhythms — seasonal, generational, evolutionary — rather than human planning cycles.

- **Emerging Commons patterns** — the Emerging Commons is not a Blueprint type but a temporary pattern domain. It holds patterns born from situations where governance frameworks do not yet exist and no proven pattern collection applies. These patterns are built from first principles alone — the First Principles and the Seven Commons Conditions applied to a situation without precedent. Their primary value is anticipatory: they help any domain Blueprint design future timeslices under radical uncertainty, or understand current pressure that existing patterns do not yet address. As the Emerging Commons patterns mature and find their domain home, they migrate into the established domains — every mature domain pattern was once an emerging pattern.

## §4 The Nine Layers

The Blueprint is organised into two structural groups: the Anatomy (L1–L6) and the Physiology (L7–L9).

**Anatomy** describes what the system *is* — its identity, design, governance, evolution, integrity, and culture. These are the slower-changing layers. A system's purpose does not change every quarter. Its governance design does not change every sprint. Its culture does not change every year. The Anatomy layers encode the deep structure that gives the system its identity over time. In the temporal specification, the Anatomy is what changes most deliberately and least frequently between timeslices.

**Physiology** describes how the system *acts* — its operational cadence, its sensing mechanisms, and its adaptive intelligence. These are the faster-changing layers. Operations are adjusted weekly. Sensing data is reviewed monthly. Learning loops are refined in response to experience. The Physiology layers encode the feedback mechanisms that allow the system to maintain vitality in a changing environment — and, crucially, to feed signals back into the Anatomy when reality challenges the design. A rich Physiology is what makes the Blueprint live rather than document.

This distinction is the architectural expression of the Eternal Iteration — applied to a single system. Anatomy changes on the timescale of seasons and years. Physiology changes on the timescale of weeks and months. Context changes continuously. The Blueprint holds the system's identity stable while enabling its behaviour to adapt — exactly what a living organism does.

### Anatomy — L1 through L6

**L1: Identity & Purpose**
The load-bearing layer of the Blueprint. Contains the system's purpose, its boundary definition, its stakeholder architecture, its market and environment specification, and the nested systems architecture that situates it within the larger commons it is embedded in. Nothing else in the Blueprint is coherent without L1. Purpose is the designed alignment mechanism that keeps human participants oriented toward value creation rather than extraction — and the precise statement of purpose is what makes it possible for sensing data to challenge it. A vague purpose cannot be contradicted by reality. A precise purpose generates clear signals when the system is drifting from it.

**L2: Design & Specification**
The structural design of the value-creating system, specified from the outside in: its stakeholder architecture, its journey design, its touchpoints, its value streams, its capabilities, its solution architecture, and its organisation design — culminating in a gap analysis against current state. L2 translates the identity established in L1 into a concrete specification of what the system does and how it is structured to do it, always beginning with the people the system serves and working inward to the structures that serve them. In a temporal specification, L2 shows how the structural design evolves between timeslices — what is built in the near term, what is transformed in the long horizon.

**L3: Governance**
The decision-making and accountability architecture of the system: governance design, feedback loop governance, conflict resolution mechanisms, graduated sanctions, justice and inclusion specifications, legitimacy and consent mechanisms, self-organisation and subsidiarity protocols, and transparency standards. Governance is not overhead — it is the social fabric of the system made structural. A commons without a governance layer is not self-governing; it is ungoverned. Governance also contains the mechanism by which signals from the Physiology are elevated to decisions about the Anatomy.

**L4: Evolution — Temporal Specification**
The mechanisms by which the Blueprint specifies and engineers its own evolution: pattern lifecycle management, time-sliced specification (baseline → near-term → long-horizon → alternative scenarios), and transformation sequencing. L4 is not where the system plans — it is where the system designs its transitions. The distinction matters: a transition design specifies the intended state at each horizon and the path between them, using sensing data to continuously validate assumptions and patterns to navigate the gaps. Transition engineering replaces projection. In the cognitive era, the cadence of L4 updates accelerates as sensing data becomes more continuous.

**L5: Integrity**
The monitoring and accountability mechanisms that ensure the system remains coherent with its own specification: alignment monitoring against purpose, compliance with self-imposed standards, and structural integrity audits. L5 is the layer that prevents drift — the gradual accumulation of small misalignments that eventually hollow out the system's vitality without any single obvious cause. L5 is also the formal escalation path: when sensing data from L8 has been processed by L9 and escalated through L7, it is L5 that formally assesses whether the Anatomy requires revision.

**L6: Culture & Ecosystem**
The living environment in which all the structural layers are enacted: the adaptive learning capacity of the community, its participation and inclusion model, its culture and workforce specification, and its ecosystem partnership design. L6 is where the Blueprint meets the social fabric that makes it workable. A technically perfect L1-L5 that ignores L6 will not survive contact with the real community that operates it.

### Physiology — L7 through L9

**L7: Operations**
The operational layer where the system's daily life is specified: operational cadence, coordination protocols, resource orchestration, anomaly response mechanisms, human-agent handoffs, and transparent operations. L7 is where the Anatomy meets reality — where the governance, design, and culture specified in L1-L6 are translated into the concrete rhythms of the working system. L7 is also the first layer where anomalies — signals that something in the system is not matching its specification — are detected and routed.

**L8: Sensing**
The system's capacity to observe itself and its environment: performance sensing (internal state against purpose) and environment sensing (external conditions against scenarios). A system that cannot sense itself cannot govern itself. L8 generates the data that L9 processes — and provides the early warning signals of vitality loss before they become structural failures. Critically, L8 does not only monitor operational performance. It monitors the continued relevance of purpose. When the environment changes in ways that make the stated purpose obsolete or misaligned, L8 should generate the signal that triggers a purpose review.

**L9: Intelligence**
The adaptive intelligence layer: multi-speed feedback loops that process sensing data at different timescales, and feedback escalation mechanisms that route anomalies to the appropriate response level. L9 is where the system learns — and where the most important decisions about whether to update the Anatomy are initiated. When L9 detects a persistent and significant pattern in sensing data that contradicts a design assumption in L1-L6, it escalates to L5 (integrity), which elevates to L3 (governance), which decides whether to initiate an Anatomy revision. This is the feedback loop that keeps the Blueprint alive.

## §5 Purpose as the Load-Bearing Element

Every Commons Blueprint opens with Purpose — L1 is always the first layer specified, and the Purpose Definition pattern is always the first pattern engaged.

This is not convention. It is structural necessity.

As the Commons Engineering Manifest establishes: nature generates vitality without purpose, through self-organisation alone. The human Commons Engineer cannot rely on this. Human participants are agents who choose. Without a clear, well-engineered purpose, participants drift toward the path of least resistance, which in any commons is extraction. Purpose is the alignment mechanism that makes participation worthwhile and extraction visibly costly.

But purpose in a Blueprint is not a statement of aspiration. It is a precise, challengeable specification: the articulation of the value the system exists to create, for whom, and at what cost to whom. Its precision is what allows sensing data to challenge it. When L8 detects that the value being created no longer matches the value specified in L1 — or when the environment has shifted such that the specified value is no longer relevant — the purpose specification is what makes the discrepancy visible and the governance process for addressing it legitimate.

This is why purpose is both the most important element of the Blueprint and the most important thing to keep current. A purpose that has been overtaken by events, but has not been updated, is an anchor dragging the system backwards. Temporal specification at L4 must include explicit mechanisms for purpose review — triggered by sensing data, governed by legitimate process, and updated when reality demands it.

The weight of purpose in the specification is calibrated to the domain. In a Life Blueprint, purpose is intimate and deeply personal. In a Business Blueprint, it is the mission that makes the organisation's existence legitimate to all stakeholders. In an Urban Blueprint, it is the civic identity that gives a settlement its character across generations. In an Ecology Blueprint, it is the lightest specification of all — a minimal human intent aligned with the self-organising vitality of the living system. When a Blueprint draws on patterns from the Emerging Commons, purpose is provisional by design: it names the best current hypothesis about what the new commons exists to achieve, held lightly and expected to evolve rapidly as the patterns mature.

## §6 Temporal Specification and Transition Engineering

The Blueprint holds the system at multiple time horizons simultaneously. This is not a property added to the Blueprint for strategic planning purposes — it is intrinsic to the architecture of any living system specification. A system that only describes its current state has no mechanism for intentional evolution. A system that only describes a distant future has no anchor in operational reality.

The four timeslices of a Commons Blueprint are:

**Baseline** — the current state of the system: all nine layers as they exist today. The baseline is the foundation of every subsequent design decision. It is honest about gaps, misalignments, and the distance between what the system intends and what it currently does.

**Near-term timeslice** — the intended state of the system in 12-24 months. This is the operational design target — close enough to be engineered with reasonable confidence, far enough to require deliberate transition design rather than incremental adjustment. Near-term timeslices are where most transition engineering work occurs.

**Long-horizon timeslice** — the intended state in 3-5+ years. This is the strategic design target — the vision of what the system should become. Long-horizon timeslices are where the most important structural decisions are made: governance architecture, culture, ecosystem partnerships, and the shape of the value creation model.

**Alternative scenarios** — specifications of the system under different environmental assumptions. The question is not "what will happen?" but "if the environment changes in this direction, what should the system become?" Scenario specifications are the commons engineer's response to uncertainty: not prediction, but preparedness.

**Transition engineering** is the systematic work of moving from one timeslice to the next. It uses sensing data from L8 to establish current position, gap analysis from L2 to measure the distance to the next timeslice, transformation sequencing from L4 to design the transition path, and governance from L3 to legitimate and resource the work. Transition engineering is not project management. It is design work — the application of patterns to close the gap between the current state of a living system and its intended next state.

In the cognitive era, the interval between timeslice updates compresses. AI-assisted sensing generates continuous data about the system's state. The near-term timeslice may be updated monthly rather than annually. At the limit, the Blueprint becomes a continuously-updated model — always current, always forward-looking, always scenario-aware. The distinction between "building the next timeslice" and "operating the current one" dissolves. This is the direction of travel for all mature Blueprint practices.

---

## §7 The Active Feedback Loop

The most important dynamic in the Blueprint architecture is not the Anatomy or the Physiology alone — it is the **feedback loop that runs from Physiology back into Anatomy**.

This loop is what makes the Blueprint an active instrument for maintaining value creation relevance, rather than a passive documentation of design intent. It works as follows:

L8 (Sensing) continuously monitors the system's actual value creation against its specified purpose. When performance data shows that the value being created is drifting from what L1 specifies — or when environment sensing shows that the context has shifted in ways that make the current purpose misaligned — L8 generates a signal.

L9 (Intelligence) processes this signal across multiple timescales. Small drifts are filtered as noise. Persistent or significant drifts are escalated as insights. L9 does not only process operational anomalies; it processes strategic anomalies — patterns in sensing data that suggest the design itself may be wrong.

L7 (Operations) routes escalated anomalies through the anomaly response mechanism and human-agent handoff protocols to the appropriate level of human decision-making. Not all anomalies require an Anatomy revision; many are handled operationally. But significant patterns reach the governance layer.

L5 (Integrity) formally assesses whether the pattern constitutes an alignment failure — a systematic departure of actual value creation from specified purpose. If so, L5 initiates a structural integrity audit and surfaces the finding to governance.

L3 (Governance) decides whether to initiate an Anatomy revision. This is the legitimation point: changes to L1 (purpose), L2 (design), or L3 itself require the consent of the governed. The governance layer protects the commons from being redesigned without legitimate process — including by its own sensing and intelligence systems.

If a revision is warranted, the Commons Engineer re-engages the Pattern Engine (Ideate → Design) to redesign the affected Anatomy layers, generating a new timeslice that is grounded in what sensing data has revealed.

This loop is what keeps the commons alive and its value creation relevant. A Blueprint that has no functional feedback loop from Physiology to Anatomy is documentation — and the commons it describes will drift until external forces impose a correction the community did not design. A Blueprint whose feedback loop is active and governed is a living instrument — and the commons it describes will continuously adapt to maintain and deepen its vitality. The Commons Engineer's primary obligation is not to produce a beautiful Blueprint on day one — it is to establish the feedback loop that will keep the commons and its value creation relevant for years.

---

## §8 The Blueprint and the Triple Diamond

The Commons Blueprint architecture maps directly onto the Triple Diamond — the three-engine model of Commons Engineering practice.

The **Context Engine** (Discover → Define) produces the Briefing: the baseline context document that maps the living system's current state, identifies the stakeholders, reads the environment, and surfaces the purpose hypothesis that L1 will formalise. Every Blueprint begins with a Briefing — because no design is valid without context.

The **Pattern Engine** (Ideate → Design) produces the Blueprint Anatomy. It applies the patterns of the Commons Blueprint collection to make concrete design decisions across L1-L6. Each pattern application is a design decision; the collection of decisions constitutes the timeslice. Transition engineering between timeslices is also Pattern Engine work: sensing the gap, selecting the patterns that close it, designing the transition path.

The **Build Engine** (Build → Iterate) operates the Physiology and constructs the transitions. It implements L7-L9 — the operational cadence, sensing mechanisms, and adaptive intelligence that generate the data the feedback loop depends on. The Build Engine never stops. Every operational cycle generates new sensing data, which feeds back into the Pattern Engine, which refines the Blueprint, which changes what is built. This is the Eternal Iteration at the system level.

The Triple Diamond is not a linear sequence. It is a cycle. Context → Pattern → Build → sensing data → new context → new patterns → new build. The Blueprint is the artefact that holds the cycle together: the living specification that carries the system's accumulated design knowledge forward through each iteration.

---

## §9 The Blueprint in the Cognitive Era

The nine-layer architecture was designed for the cognitive era. Two properties of the architecture are particularly important as AI capabilities develop.

The first is the **Anatomy/Physiology separation as the precondition for legitimate human-AI collaboration**. The Anatomy layers (L1-L6) are primarily human territory. Purpose, governance, culture, and the structural evolution of a living system require the kind of judgment, contextual wisdom, and moral clarity that human participants bring to a commons. These layers change slowly and deliberately, and the decisions made within them require legitimacy — the consent of the governed. No AI system has the authority to revise purpose, redesign governance, or alter culture unilaterally. These are human acts.

The Physiology layers (L7-L9) are where human-AI collaboration is most natural and most powerful. Operational coordination, performance sensing, anomaly detection, and multi-speed feedback processing are exactly the capabilities that AI agents can provide continuously, at scale, and without the cognitive overhead that makes these functions difficult for human teams to maintain. The `Human-Agent Handoff` pattern (L7) is the explicit architectural mechanism for managing the boundary between human judgment and AI execution — ensuring that when sensing data escalates to a decision requiring human governance, the handoff is clean, documented, and legitimate.

The second is the **cadence compression** described in the Preamble. In the cognitive era, the interval between Blueprint updates compresses as AI-assisted sensing generates continuous data. Communities that invest in rich L7-L9 implementations will move through timeslices faster — updating their near-term specification monthly, sensing strategic drift in near-real-time, and updating their long-horizon vision in response to continuous environmental scanning rather than periodic strategic reviews. The Blueprint moves from document to model. The frames per second increase until the specification and the living system are effectively the same thing — the Blueprint is always now, always forward, always current.

A Commons Blueprint that specifies its L7-L9 clearly is a blueprint that can be operated by a network of human and AI agents working in concert — each contributing where their capabilities are strongest, governed by the values and rules established in L1-L6, keeping the feedback loop active at a speed no purely human team could sustain alone.

---

## §10 The Commons Blueprint Collection

The Commons Blueprint is supported by a curated pattern collection, each pattern assigned to a specific layer, together constituting the complete pattern language of the architecture.

| Layer | Role | Patterns |
|---|---|---|
| L1 Identity & Purpose | The load-bearing foundation | commons-boundary-definition, market-environment-specification, nested-systems-architecture, purpose-definition, stakeholder-architecture |
| L2 Design & Specification | Structural design | capability-specification, gap-analysis, journey-design, organization-design, scenario-specification, solution-architecture, value-proposition-design, value-stream-specification |
| L3 Governance | Decision-making architecture | conflict-resolution-mechanism, feedback-loop-governance, governance-design, graduated-sanctions, justice-and-inclusion-specification, legitimacy-and-consent, self-organization-and-subsidiarity, transparency-and-openness-protocol |
| L4 Evolution | Temporal specification & transition engineering | pattern-lifecycle, time-sliced-specification, transformation-sequencing |
| L5 Integrity | Coherence monitoring & escalation | alignment-monitoring, compliance-and-regulatory-specification, structural-integrity-audit |
| L6 Culture & Ecosystem | Living environment | adaptive-learning, community-and-participation-model, culture-and-workforce-specification, ecosystem-partnership-design |
| L7 Operations | Daily operational life & anomaly routing | anomaly-response, coordination-protocol, human-agent-handoff, operational-cadence, resource-orchestration, transparent-operations |
| L8 Sensing | System & environment observation | environment-sensing, performance-sensing |
| L9 Intelligence | Adaptive learning & strategic escalation | feedback-escalation, multi-speed-feedback |

All patterns in the collection exist in the pattern library and are connected to the master `commons-blueprint` pattern through the `specializes_to` relationship. They are tagged `commons_domain: [meta]` — applicable across all four domains of Commons Engineering practice.

The collection is in draft status. Pattern content is substantive and well-structured. The `commons_assessment` schema will be upgraded to the current standard as part of the wider pattern library v7 migration.

## §11 Relationship to Other Manifests

The Commons Blueprint Manifest sits between the taxonomy and the domain manifests in the manifest hierarchy:

- **Commons Engineering Manifest** — establishes the field, the four domains, the definition of a commons, vitality as the organising principle, and purpose as the load-bearing element of human commons design. The Blueprint Manifest inherits all of these foundations.
- **Commons Engine Manifest** — establishes the four engines (Context, Pattern, Lighthouse, Community) and the centripetal pattern model that organises the library. The Blueprint is the artefact into which all four engines flow.
- **Commons Engineer Manifest** — establishes who practices Commons Engineering: the four paths into the practice, the 7Cs developmental arc, and the two curated pattern collections that form the curriculum. The Blueprint is the primary artefact through which the Commons Engineer's practice becomes concrete — the instrument they grow toward through the 7Cs, then wield in the systems they design for and with others.
- **Commons Incubator Manifest** — describes the deployment mechanism through which the Blueprint reaches living systems. The Incubator is the actor that helps a community build its Blueprint and establish the feedback loop that keeps it alive.
- **Life Engineering Manifest** *(forthcoming)* — will specify the Life Blueprint as the domain specialisation at the organism scale.
- **Business Engineering Manifest** *(forthcoming)* — will specify the Business Blueprint at the enterprise scale.
- **Urban Engineering Manifest** *(forthcoming)* — will specify the Urban Blueprint at the settlement scale.
- **Ecology Engineering Manifest** *(forthcoming)* — will specify the Ecology Blueprint at the biosphere scale.
- **Emerging Commons** — not a separate manifest but a temporary pattern domain. Patterns from the Emerging Commons inform all domain Blueprints when designing under radical uncertainty or addressing pressure that established patterns do not yet cover.

The Commons Blueprint is not the property of any single domain. It is the shared artefact architecture of the entire Commons Engineering practice — the temporal specification language that makes all domain Blueprints legible to each other, to the pattern library that connects them, and to the communities that will operate and evolve them long after the Commons Engineer has moved on.
