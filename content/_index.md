# Commons Engineering

Every field begins with a name. The name is not merely a label — it is a claim. It says: this territory has enough coherence, enough depth, enough precedent in practice, and enough urgency in application to be treated as a discipline.

**Commons Engineering is that claim.**

## The Four Engines

- **[Context Engine](/engines/context-engine/)** — reads living systems before design begins
- **[Pattern Engine](/engines/pattern-engine/)** — the collective intelligence of the practice
- **[Lighthouse Engine](/engines/lighthouse-engine/)** — discovers, documents, and builds vital systems
- **[Community Engine](/engines/community-engine/)** — builds the practitioner community

## The Four Domains

| Domain | Field | Scale | What is created |
|---|---|---|---|
| Life | Life Engineering | Organism | Individual flourishing |
| Business | Business Engineering | Enterprise | Value creation per purpose |
| Urban | Urban Engineering | Settlement | Place vitality |
| Ecology | Ecology Engineering | Biosphere | Planetary vitality |
