# About Commons Engineering

Every field begins with a name. The name is not merely a label — it is a claim. It says: this territory has enough coherence, enough depth, enough precedent in practice, and enough urgency in application to be treated as a discipline.

**Commons Engineering is that claim.**

It is the discipline of designing living systems — individuals, organisations, cities, ecosystems — toward vitality rather than extraction. It provides a design language, a knowledge commons, a qualification process, and a practitioner community for building systems that are resilient, collaborative, and genuinely alive.

## Who We Are

Commons Engineering is built and stewarded by [cloudsters](https://cloudsters.net) — a small team committed to making the tools and knowledge for designing living systems open, accessible, and community-owned.
