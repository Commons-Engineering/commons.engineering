> Every system has two maps: the one on the wall, and the one that actually describes how value moves. The Commons Engineer always works from the second map.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (High)
> Value Grid Discovery is the foundational diagnostic practice of Commons Engineering. The insight that formal structures rarely describe actual value flows has been confirmed in organisational, urban, and ecological systems analysis. The transit map metaphor — tracing actual value movement rather than formal hierarchy — is a reliable tool for surfacing the true leverage points in any living system.

### Section 1: Context

Every living system has two maps. The first map is the official one: the org chart, the governance document, the strategic plan, the stated mission. It describes how the system is supposed to work, where authority formally sits, and what value is claimed to flow where.

The second map is the one that actually describes how the system functions: who provides real value to whom, what is actually exchanged, where energy pools and where it leaks, which relationships carry genuine weight. This is the value grid — the transit map of the living system.

A Commons Engineer's first diagnostic move in any system — including their own life — is to construct the second map. Before proposing any intervention, before redesigning any structure, before adding any resource, they need to understand the value grid: who gives what, who receives what, what is exchanged, and where the flows are blocked, missing, or misaligned with the system's stated purpose.

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Formal Structure vs. Actual Value Flows.**

The forces that make this mapping difficult are persistent:

**Force 1: The org chart substitution.** Most practitioners default to working from formal structures — the org chart, the governance document, the process flow — because these are visible, legible, and sanctioned. The actual value flows are often invisible, informal, and politically sensitive to name. But the org chart describes authority, not value. They are rarely the same map.

**Force 2: The single-value assumption.** Living systems generate and exchange multiple forms of value simultaneously: financial, relational, intellectual, physical, reputational, and commons value. Most diagnostic frameworks measure only one or two of these. A practitioner who maps only financial flows misses the relational exchanges that make financial flows possible. A practitioner who maps only formal outputs misses the informal knowledge exchanges that create real capability.

**Force 3: The static map problem.** Value grids are not fixed. They evolve as relationships develop, as context changes, as participants join and leave. A map drawn six months ago may not describe today's system accurately. The Value Grid Discovery practice is not a one-time exercise — it is a recurring diagnostic.

**Force 4: The self-diagnosis bias.** When applying this diagnostic to their own life system, practitioners systematically overestimate the value they provide in weakened relationships and underestimate the value they receive from overlooked ones. An honest value grid of a life system requires the same external-facing honesty that the practitioner applies to client systems.

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, before any design intervention, map the actual flows of value in the system — who gives what, who receives what, and where the flows are blocked or misaligned with the system's stated purpose.**

The Value Grid has two dimensions: the participants (all stakeholders who give or receive value in the system), and the flows (all forms of value exchanged between them). The grid is complete when every significant exchange is mapped — not just the financial flows, not just the formal outputs, but the full ecology of what moves between participants.

Value takes six forms in any commons system:
- **Financial value**: money, resources, assets, economic access
- **Relational value**: trust, belonging, connection, partnership potential
- **Intellectual value**: knowledge, patterns, frameworks, problem-solving capacity
- **Physical value**: space, infrastructure, material resources, tools
- **Reputational value**: credibility, visibility, endorsement, social proof
- **Commons value**: shared capacity, resilience, collective intelligence, governed resources

A complete Value Grid maps all six forms for all significant stakeholder relationships. Most diagnostic frameworks map one or two. The Commons Engineer maps all six.

### Section 4: Implementation

**Step 1: List all participants.** Who are the actual stakeholders of this system — not the aspirational ones, but the ones who currently give or receive value of any kind? Include the obvious ones (funders, clients, employees, partners) and the less obvious (communities affected, future generations, the commons itself). Don't edit for inclusion yet — list everyone who could plausibly be on the grid.

**Step 2: Map the flows.** For each pair of participants who have a relationship, map what flows between them. Use the six-form taxonomy (financial, relational, intellectual, physical, reputational, commons). Ask: what does each participant give to each other participant? What do they receive in return? What do they expect to receive that they are not currently receiving?

**Step 3: Identify the gaps and blockages.** Where are the flows thin, missing, or blocked? Where is value being generated but not flowing to its intended recipients? Where is value leaving the system without return? Where are participants giving without receiving, or receiving without giving? These asymmetries are the primary diagnostic signal.

**Step 4: Identify the leverage points.** Which relationships, if strengthened or redesigned, would have the greatest effect on the system's overall vitality? Where is a small change in flow likely to produce a large change in system behaviour? These are the leverage points — the design targets for any subsequent intervention.

**Step 5: Test the map with participants.** Share the draft value grid with participants in the system. Ask: does this ring true? Where is it wrong? What have we missed? The participant response is the most reliable quality filter — and the act of sharing the map often catalyses the conversations that improve the system directly.

**Step 6: Update regularly.** Schedule a recurring review of the value grid — at minimum annually, ideally quarterly. A living system's flows evolve. The map that described the system twelve months ago may not describe it accurately today.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What this pattern creates:**

A practitioner who completes a Value Grid Discovery of any system — including their own life — gains a qualitatively different view of what interventions are available to them. Instead of adding resources to the system, they can redirect existing flows. Instead of solving the problem they can see, they can address the structural misalignment that is generating it. The leverage available from working with actual flows is consistently higher than the leverage available from working with formal structures.

At the system level, a Value Grid Discovery shared with participants often produces immediate improvements — simply because making the flows visible creates the conversations that were previously missing. The diagnostic is itself an intervention.

**What this pattern risks:**

Value Grid Discovery can produce analysis paralysis if it is treated as a precondition for all action rather than a guide for high-leverage action. The map does not need to be complete before any intervention is taken — it needs to be complete enough to identify the highest-leverage intervention. The engineering attitude requires moving from diagnosis to design before the diagnosis becomes an end in itself.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Life Engineering practice (Commons Engineering community, 2025–present):** The Value Grid Discovery is the diagnostic entry point for the Life Blueprint. New Commons Engineers map their own life system's value flows as one of the first structured exercises in the programme — identifying where they are giving value without return, where they are receiving value without acknowledgement, and where the flows in their professional and personal relationships are misaligned with their stated purpose. The exercise consistently surfaces leverage points that willpower-based improvement misses.

**Community organising (multiple domains):** Experienced community organisers consistently use a version of this diagnostic before designing any campaign or intervention: mapping who holds what resources, what relationships exist and between whom, and where the formal power structure diverges from the actual flow of influence and resources. The transit map of the community — not the formal governance structure — is the working document for effective organising.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In the Cognitive Age, the Value Grid becomes both more complex and more mappable. More complex, because the participants in most systems now include AI agents whose contributions and consumptions of value are not yet legible in standard stakeholder frameworks. More mappable, because AI tools can assist with the synthesis of complex multi-stakeholder value flows — processing interview data, public information, and observable patterns into draft value grids that human practitioners then validate and refine.

The practitioner who maintains an updated Value Grid of their own system — including their AI collaborators as participants with genuine contributions and dependencies — is positioned to orchestrate those collaborators more effectively. The grid specifies who does what for whom; the orchestrator uses that specification to direct capacity toward the highest-leverage flows.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

A practitioner or team actively using Value Grid Discovery has a recognisable quality of diagnostic precision. Before proposing any intervention, they ask: where is this in the value grid? Who is currently not receiving the value they should? What flow needs to be created, strengthened, or redirected? The diagnostic question comes before the solution proposal.

The most powerful sign of vitality is the frequency with which the grid is updated and the willingness to let it reveal uncomfortable truths — about who is being undervalued, which relationships are extractive, and where the system's stated purpose diverges from its actual behaviour.

**Signs of decay:**

Decay in value grid practice looks like the substitution of the org chart for the transit map. The practitioner stops asking about actual flows and defaults to working within formal structures. The diagnostic capacity atrophies. Interventions become increasingly structural in form and decreasingly structural in effect — reorganising without redirecting, adding resources without changing flows.

The recovery is always a return to the transit map: who is actually giving what to whom, and what is actually flowing in return?
