summary: The discipline of recognising and documenting patterns from your own practice
  as they occur. Each pattern captured is a unit of knowledge that can be shared,
  taught, built upon, and contributed to the commons. Pattern capture is the primary
  raw material for thought leadership, the Pattern Engine, and the compounding of
  Capital.

> Every time you notice that something worked — or didn't — you are standing at the source of a pattern. The discipline is to stop, name what you are seeing, and write it down.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (High)
> Pattern capture is one of the most directly productive practices available to a knowledge worker. The evidence is consistent: practitioners who document patterns from their own experience develop faster, build credibility more efficiently, and contribute more to their communities than those who accumulate equivalent experience without documentation.

### Section 1: Context

Every practitioner accumulates experience. They observe what works and what doesn't. They develop intuitions about which approaches succeed in which contexts. They build mental models of the systems they work with. This accumulated understanding is the most valuable thing they have.

And yet most of it stays tacit — embedded in the practitioner's intuitions and habits but never externalised into a form that can be shared, taught, tested, or built upon. When the practitioner leaves an organisation, the knowledge leaves with them. When a new practitioner joins the domain, they start from zero — making the same mistakes, discovering the same solutions, learning the same lessons that their predecessors learned years earlier.

Pattern capture is the practice that breaks this cycle. By recognising and documenting recurring solutions in a form that others can use, the practitioner converts personal experience into shared knowledge — and begins the compounding process that makes communities of practice more capable than the sum of their individual members.

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Experience Accumulated vs. Knowledge Captured.**

The forces that keep experience tacit are persistent:

**Force 1: The in-the-moment pressure.** Pattern recognition happens during active work, when there is no time to stop and document. The practitioner notices something — "this worked because..." — and files it as an intuition, intending to document it later. Later rarely comes. The insight sinks back into tacit knowledge.

**Force 2: The sophistication barrier.** Many practitioners believe their observations are not worth documenting until they are "sophisticated enough" — fully generalised, rigorously tested, clearly differentiated from known patterns. But the most valuable patterns are often simple ones, close to specific practice, that are not yet in any library. The sophistication barrier prevents exactly the most needed contributions.

**Force 3: The format barrier.** Practitioners who have never worked with pattern libraries often don't know what a pattern looks like or how to structure one. The structure feels academic or bureaucratic — something that requires specialised skills. In fact, a useful pattern can be written in four sentences: here's the context, here's the problem, here's the solution, here's what to watch for.

**Force 4: The ownership confusion.** Some practitioners feel that documenting patterns from their field work requires permission — from their employer, their client, or the people involved in the situation. In most cases, patterns can be anonymised and generalised without this concern arising. The question is: does the documented pattern reveal confidential specifics, or does it describe a generally applicable approach?

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, build a regular practice of recognising patterns in your own work and documenting them in a form accessible to others — starting with the simplest useful format and refining over time.**

Pattern capture has two phases: recognition and documentation.

**Recognition** is the practice of asking, after every significant professional experience: "Was there a recurring structure here? Did I observe a context-problem-solution relationship that I have seen before, or that I would recognise again?" This is the pattern-recognition question. It is most reliably applied as a regular review practice — weekly or after each significant project — rather than in the moment.

**Documentation** is converting the recognised pattern into a form that others can use. The minimum viable pattern documentation requires three elements: the context (in what situation does this pattern apply?), the problem (what tension or challenge does it address?), and the solution (what approach resolves the tension, and how does it work?). This takes 200–400 words for even a complex pattern.

### Section 4: Implementation

**Step 1: Build the recognition habit.** After every significant project, meeting, or intervention, spend 10 minutes asking: "Did I see a recurring pattern here? Did something work that I have seen work before? Did something fail in a way I have seen before?" Write down the observation in a few sentences — not a full pattern, just a note.

**Step 2: Maintain a pattern inbox.** Keep a simple document or note where you capture raw pattern observations — the 3-sentence notes from Step 1. Review this inbox monthly. Identify the observations that appear more than once (these are the clearest pattern signals) or that feel most generative.

**Step 3: Draft the minimum viable pattern.** For each prioritised observation, write a minimum viable pattern: 2-3 sentences of context, 2-3 sentences of problem, 3-5 sentences of solution. This is enough to be useful. Do not wait for it to be comprehensive.

**Step 4: Test the pattern with a peer.** Share the draft with one or two colleagues who work in the same domain. Ask: "Does this ring true? Have you seen this too? What would you add or change?" The peer response is the first quality filter and often improves the pattern significantly.

**Step 5: Contribute to the library.** When a pattern has been tested and refined, contribute it to the pattern library — whether the Commons Engineering library or a community-specific library. Use the Pattern Spec format if available. The contribution is the final step of capture: turning personal knowledge into commons knowledge.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What this pattern creates:**

A practitioner who maintains a pattern capture practice builds a compounding intellectual capital asset. Over one year of consistent practice, a typical practitioner will document 12–20 patterns from their own field experience. These patterns represent compressed, contextualised knowledge that took years of practice to accumulate — but that can be shared and applied by others in hours. The leverage ratio is extraordinary.

At the community level, a group of practitioners who all maintain pattern capture practices generates a knowledge library that advances faster than any individual could advance it — because each practitioner is contributing observations from different contexts, which together reveal patterns of greater generality than any one practitioner could see alone.

**What this pattern risks:**

Pattern capture can become pattern production for its own sake — a documentation habit that generates volume without quality. The test is always practical: is this pattern useful to someone who didn't have my exact experience? If the pattern is too context-specific to be generalisable, it is a case study, not a pattern.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**The Commons Engineering pattern library (2025–26):** The library that underlies Commons Engineering practice is built entirely through pattern capture by practitioners from multiple domains. The 1,989 patterns in the Life Engineering collection represent the accumulated pattern capture of the community across several years of practice. The quality of the collection is a direct function of the consistency of the capture practice.

**War gaming and military after-action reviews:** The military's institutionalised after-action review process is one of the oldest large-scale pattern capture systems. After every significant operation, units formally review what happened, what worked, what didn't, and what lessons should be extracted. The lessons are documented and distributed, creating a pattern library that improves future operations. The pattern capture practice is the mechanism — without it, every operation starts from the beginning.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In the Cognitive Age, pattern capture becomes both more important and more powerful. It becomes more important because AI systems are trained on and generate from public knowledge — and practitioners who do not capture and publish their patterns contribute nothing to the AI-accessible knowledge commons. It becomes more powerful because AI tools can assist with the capture process: generating draft patterns from rough notes, identifying connections between new patterns and existing library entries, and helping practitioners structure their observations in standard formats.

The practitioner who maintains a pattern capture practice in the Cognitive Age is not just building their own intellectual capital — they are building the training data for the AI systems that will assist future practitioners. This is a form of knowledge stewardship that operates across generations.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

A practitioner with an active pattern capture practice has a distinctive relationship to their own experience: they treat everything they do as potential knowledge. Failed projects are as valuable as successful ones — often more so, because the failure reveals the edge conditions of a pattern more clearly than the success. The practitioner with an active capture practice has a quality of learning velocity: they develop faster than their experience base would predict, because they are compressing and storing experience in a form that their future self can access and build on.

**Signs of decay:**

Decay in pattern capture practice looks like the accumulation of tacit knowledge without capture. The practitioner's experience grows, their intuitions deepen, their effectiveness improves — but no documentation is produced. The pattern inbox empties. The library receives no contributions. When this happens, the practitioner is consuming from the commons without contributing to it — a pattern that is sustainable in the short term but depletes the community's collective intelligence over time. The recovery is always a return to the recognition habit: after the next significant experience, spend 10 minutes asking "what pattern was here?"
