# Pattern Library

The Pattern Engine maps, qualifies, and connects every pattern of human practice across the commons domains. Patterns enter at the outer edge — specific, contextual — and move inward toward universality as evidence accumulates through deployment.

## Domains

| Domain | Scale | Patterns |
|---|---|---|
| Life Engineering | Organism | ~1,980 |
| Urban Engineering | Settlement | ~11,564 |
| Business Engineering | Enterprise | Coming soon |
| Ecology Engineering | Biosphere | Coming soon |

## Core Patterns

The seven foundational patterns that make all other patterns possible:

- **The System Is the Self** — You are a living system. Apply engineering rigour to yourself.
- **Coherence as Leverage** — Alignment between purpose, decisions, and action is the highest leverage point.
- **Engineering Attitude** — Diagnose before prescribing, design before building, test before scaling.
- **Dual Fear as Compass** — Personal fear and moral fear are navigational instruments, not inhibitors.
- **Visibility as Commons Act** — Publishing and teaching is stewardship, not self-promotion.
- **Patterns over Protocols** — Search the library before inventing.
- **Orchestration over Execution** — Shift from executing tasks to directing systems.
