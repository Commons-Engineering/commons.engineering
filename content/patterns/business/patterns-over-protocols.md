      Patterns compound the intelligence of the commons by making accumulated
      learning reusable. Every practitioner who uses a pattern rather than
      reinventing builds on the community's collective experience.
      Every practitioner who validates, adapts, and re-contributes a pattern
      improves the commons resource. The pattern as unit of knowledge is
      the mechanism through which vitality accumulates across practitioners
      and generations.

> The intelligence of the commons lives in its patterns. Before you design, search. Before you search, learn the language.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (High)
> This pattern rests on Alexander's foundational insight that architectural and design intelligence is most durably transmitted through patterns rather than rules or procedures. It has been validated across software engineering (Design Patterns, 1994), organisational design, urban planning, and now Commons Engineering. The principle holds at every scale: accumulated, contextualised wisdom outperforms context-free procedure and contextless invention.

---

### Section 1: Context

Every domain of practice accumulates knowledge. Practitioners observe what works, in what contexts, under what conditions. Some of this knowledge is formalised as rules, regulations, or procedures. Some of it is transmitted through apprenticeship and experience. Much of it is lost — it lives only in the memories of practitioners who retire, move on, or simply never thought to document it.

The pattern — as Christopher Alexander defined it — is the most efficient known mechanism for capturing and transmitting contextualised practical knowledge. A pattern is not a rule (which mandates) or a procedure (which prescribes). It is a documented relationship between a context, a problem, and a solution — described with enough clarity that a practitioner in a different setting can recognise the context, understand the problem, and adapt the solution.

The Commons Engineering pattern library represents the accumulated practical intelligence of practitioners across Life, Business, Urban, and Ecology domains. It is the knowledge commons of the practice. And the most important principle governing its use is this: search before inventing.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is the Invention Instinct vs. Accumulated Wisdom.**

The forces that drive practitioners to reinvent rather than reuse are deeply embedded:

**Force 1: The not-invented-here instinct.** Practitioners who are intellectually capable and experienced often feel that reusing someone else's solution is a failure of their own capability. This instinct is understandable and occasionally correct — there are situations where no existing pattern applies and genuine invention is required. But it is almost always activated too early, before the library has been seriously searched.

**Force 2: The vocabulary problem.** Pattern libraries are only accessible to practitioners who know the vocabulary of the patterns. A practitioner who doesn't know that "stakeholder architecture" is the name for a specific design problem will not find the patterns that address it. Pattern literacy — knowing the names and rough definitions of the major patterns in a domain — is a prerequisite for effective library search.

**Force 3: The "my context is unique" belief.** Practitioners routinely overestimate the uniqueness of their context. Every context has genuinely unique features, but the pattern-level problems almost always recur across contexts. The practitioner who insists that their governance challenge is unique to their organisation is usually wrong — and wastes significant resources designing a solution that already exists.

**Force 4: The quality gap perception.** Practitioners sometimes assume that established patterns are lower-quality than what they could design themselves. This is occasionally true — some patterns are underdeveloped — but as a general principle it is false. A well-developed pattern encodes the learning from many applications, including failure modes and edge cases that the first-time designer has not yet encountered.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, before designing any significant intervention, search the pattern library first — adapting an existing pattern if one fits, creating a new one only when the library genuinely has no applicable solution.**

The search-first principle has three phases:

**Phase 1: Pattern literacy.** Before effective searching is possible, the practitioner needs to know enough of the pattern vocabulary to recognise relevant patterns when they find them. This is not memorisation — it is familiarity. Know the names, know the rough domains, know the relationships between major patterns. The Commons Engineer collection and the broader library provide this orientation.

**Phase 2: Library search.** With a specific problem in hand, search the library for patterns that address it. The search should be generous — look for patterns in adjacent domains, not just the domain of the immediate problem. Some of the most powerful patterns for Business Engineering come from Life Engineering, and vice versa. The cross-domain connections in the pattern library are often where the most generative solutions live.

**Phase 3: Contextual adaptation.** Patterns are not plug-and-play solutions. They are documented relationships between context, problem, and solution — and the solution requires adaptation to each new context. The practitioner who applies a pattern must understand why it works, what conditions it requires, and what must be adjusted for their specific situation. This adaptation is not a failure of the pattern — it is how patterns evolve.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**Step 1: Articulate the problem in pattern terms.** Before searching, write a one-paragraph problem statement that names the context, the tension, and the desired resolution. This articulation serves two purposes: it makes the search more precise, and it often reveals that the problem is more common than it seemed — which is the first indicator that a pattern probably exists.

**Step 2: Search the library.** Use the vocabulary of the problem statement to search the pattern library. Look for patterns with similar context descriptions, similar tension names, or similar solution mechanisms. Read the summary, then the problem, then the solution. Does this pattern address the problem you articulated?

**Step 3: Read the consequences.** Before deciding to apply a pattern, read the consequences section carefully. What does the pattern require? What does it risk? What conditions make it work? What conditions make it fail? If the pattern's requirements don't fit your context, look for alternatives or variants.

**Step 4: Adapt with documentation.** Apply the pattern with conscious adaptation to your context. As you adapt, document the adaptations: why was the pattern modified, what worked, what didn't. This documentation is the raw material for contributing a new variant or refinement back to the library.

**Step 5: Contribute the learning.** After applying a pattern, contribute your observation back to the commons. This may be a note on the pattern's page, a new variant documented as a specialisation, or a new pattern if the context was genuinely different enough to require a distinct solution. The pattern library grows through this cycle of application and contribution.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What this pattern creates:**

A practitioner who applies this principle consistently makes fewer expensive mistakes, because they are building on accumulated experience rather than re-learning lessons already encoded in the library. Their design work becomes faster over time, because pattern recognition replaces fresh invention for the majority of challenges they face. And they contribute to the library's growth through their adaptations, making the commons resource richer for those who follow.

**What this pattern risks:**

The pattern-first principle can produce mechanical application — using a pattern because it exists rather than because it fits. A practitioner who applies patterns without genuine contextual adaptation produces brittle solutions that look right on paper but fail when tested. The antidote is always the engineering attitude: diagnose before prescribing, which includes diagnosing whether the pattern actually fits the problem before committing to it.

---

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Software engineering (1994–present):** The Design Patterns movement in software engineering is the most direct large-scale validation of this principle. The book by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides documented 23 patterns for object-oriented design that had been observed across many successful software systems. The result was not a rulebook — it was a vocabulary that allowed practitioners to communicate about solutions at a higher level of abstraction and to benefit from accumulated experience they had not personally accumulated.

**Ostrom's design principles for commons governance:** Elinor Ostrom's documentation of the design principles that characterise successful commons — clear boundaries, proportional rules, collective choice, monitoring, graduated sanctions, conflict resolution, and external recognition — is exactly this pattern: context, problem, solution at the governance level of commons design. Every successful commons governance design since has built on these eight principles, adapted to specific contexts.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In the Cognitive Age, pattern literacy becomes a more rather than less important skill. AI systems are extraordinarily good at generating text and code — but they generate from statistical patterns in their training data, not from validated, contextually understood design patterns. The practitioner who can evaluate AI-generated output against a rich pattern library has a quality filter that the practitioner without pattern literacy lacks.

AI also makes pattern search faster and more accessible. A practitioner with deep pattern literacy who uses AI for library search can find relevant patterns across domains faster than any manual search allows. But the pattern literacy is a prerequisite — the practitioner who searches without knowing the vocabulary will find noise rather than signal.

---

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

A practitioner or community that applies patterns-over-protocols has a distinctive quality of confident speed. They move quickly on design problems because they are adapting proven solutions rather than inventing from scratch. Their language is rich with pattern references — they describe challenges in terms of known tensions and solutions, which makes communication faster and more precise.

The most powerful sign is the quality of their contributions back to the library: adaptations that genuinely refine patterns, new patterns that fill genuine gaps, connections between patterns that the original documentation missed.

**Signs of decay:**

Decay in this pattern looks like re-invention without searching. The practitioner or community begins solving problems it has already solved, because the discipline of searching the library first has lapsed. The pattern library grows stale — contributions thin out, existing patterns are not updated, and new practitioners don't know it exists. The recovery is always a return to library-first discipline and a recommitment to contributing adaptations back to the commons.
