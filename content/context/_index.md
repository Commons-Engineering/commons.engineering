# Context Engine

The Commons Engineer never begins with patterns. They begin with context.

A pattern applied without context is not engineering — it is decoration. The Context Engine is the structured process for understanding *this* living system, *these* stakeholders, *these* forces — before a single pattern is selected or a Blueprint designed.

## What the Context Engine Produces

- **Briefings** — baseline specifications capturing purpose, stakeholder architecture, value flows, capabilities, and forcing functions
- **Living Blueprints** — continuously updated system models connected to sensing layers

## Delivery Modes

- **Sovereign Stack** — pattern infrastructure integrated into an organisation's own systems
- **Ambience Stack** — patterns injected into existing workflows and tools without requiring platform changes
