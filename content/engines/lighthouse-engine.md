# Lighthouse Engine

A Commons Lighthouse is any vital system that embodies the principles of Commons Engineering in practice. The Lighthouse Engine discovers existing vital systems and makes them visible, transforms existing systems by amplifying their vitality through pattern application, and builds new vital systems from the ground up.
