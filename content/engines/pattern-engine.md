# Pattern Engine

The Pattern Engine maps, qualifies, and connects every pattern of human practice within the commons domains. It holds the pattern library — spanning Life, Business, Urban, Ecology, and the Emerging Commons. It infers relationships between patterns across domains through the GraphRAG architecture. It suggests patterns based on context. It grows through use.
