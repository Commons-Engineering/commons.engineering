# Community Engine

The Community Engine builds and sustains the community of Commons Engineers through which all the other engines grow. It connects practitioners, distributes pattern knowledge, builds sensing capacity, and makes the invisible visible — finding the Commons Engineers who are already at work without the language to name what they are doing.
