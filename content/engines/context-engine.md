# Context Engine

The Commons Engineer never begins with patterns. They begin with context.

A pattern applied without context is not engineering — it is decoration. The Context Engine is the structured process for understanding *this* living system, *these* stakeholders, *these* forces — before a single pattern is selected or a Blueprint designed.
