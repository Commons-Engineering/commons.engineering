# The Four Engines

The Commons Engine runs four interconnected engines. Each is necessary. None is sufficient alone. The power is in their intersection.

- [Context Engine](context-engine/) — reads living systems before design begins
- [Pattern Engine](pattern-engine/) — the collective intelligence of the practice
- [Lighthouse Engine](lighthouse-engine/) — discovers, documents, and builds vital systems
- [Community Engine](community-engine/) — builds the practitioner community
